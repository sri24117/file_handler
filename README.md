# file_handler

The above code provides a basic Django web application for managing and analyzing uploaded files. Here's a brief overview of the main functionality:

Authentication: The application requires users to log in before they can access certain views, using Django's built-in authentication system. The login_view function handles the login form submission, while the admin_panel, upload_file, open_file, and download_file views are decorated with the @login_required decorator to restrict access to authenticated users only.

File upload: The upload_file view allows users to upload a file to the server. When a file is uploaded, it is saved as an instance of the UploadedFile model, which has a single FileField attribute for storing the file.

File listing and management: The admin_panel view displays a list of all uploaded files, along with links to view, download, and delete each file. Deleting a file removes it from the server and from the database.

File analysis: The open_file view allows users to view the contents of an uploaded file, either as a CSV or an Excel file. When a file is opened, its contents are converted to a Pandas DataFrame, which is then passed to the file_data.html template for rendering.

File download: The download_file view allows users to download an uploaded file directly from the server. When a file is downloaded, its contents are streamed back to the user as an octet-stream.
